# documentos.design

> Refactoring of the website https://documentos.design, a website for researchers to share their documents collections for the study of brazilian graphic and product design history.

Still a work in progress, definitly not ready for production use.
I am using Nuxt.js and Keystone.js. For detailed explanation on how things work, checkout the [Nuxt.js docs](https://github.com/nuxt/nuxt.js) and [Keystone.js docs](https://keystonejs.com/documentation/).

Cloned and modified from [keyuxt](https://github.com/keycircle/keyuxt)
